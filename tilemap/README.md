# Tile Map
This subproject provides a [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) map with
[slippy map tile](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) overlays for zoom levels 14 and 17.
A tile is colored if one or your rides, runs, or hikes touches that tile. 
This is similar to what [VeloViewer](https://veloviewer.com/explorer), [StatsHunters](https://www.statshunters.com),
and especially [Squadrats](https://squadrats.com/activities) provide.
In addition, the current GPS position is marked with a red cross (given that you allow location tracking when asked by your browser).
That way you can explore whether you already covered the tile at the current location.
